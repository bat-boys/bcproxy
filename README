This is a TCP proxy intended to sit between your telnet MUD client and BatMUD.
It turns on "BatClient-mode" and filters the BatClient messages the server
sends.

Features
========

 - more colors: 24-bit colors sent by BatMUD are approximated to closest-match
   xterm-256color escapes
 - message classification: different types of messages have their type visible.
   examples:
```
chan_tell: You tell Lotheac 'hello'
spec_spell: You watch with self-pride as your golden arrow hits Adult skunk.
```
 - mapping: room descriptions & exits (edges between rooms) are stored in a
   database as you play (requires `set client_mapper_toggle on` configured in
   game). no support yet for map visualization.
 - prots: a line with duration is displayed for every prot status update sent
   by BatMUD. you should set up client triggers for this. example:
```
[prots]force_absorption 805
[prots]displacement 380
[prots]force_absorption 802
[prots]displacement 377
```
 - target status: when BatMUD sends updates about your current target's health
   percentage, a line is printed. examples:
```
[target]Small_shrew 100
<omitted text>
Small shrew is DEAD, R.I.P.
[target]0 0
```

Setup
=====

 - install postgreqsl client libraries (`libpq` or `libpq-dev`) and a
   postgresql server
 - run `./configure`
 - compile with BSD `make` (available as `bmake` on Linuxes)
 - set up a postgresql database named `batmud`
 - `./bcproxy 1234`
 - connect your mud client to localhost:1234

Bugs
====

Stacking of control codes is not completely correct (ref. proxy.c:on_open),
which means that setting both background and foreground colors doesn't work
currently.
